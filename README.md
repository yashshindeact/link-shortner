# link-shortner
The main goal of this project is to create a simple Link Shortner applicatuon using java. A Link Shortner is a tool that takes a long URL and generates a short, unique identifier, allowing users to share concise links. This project will give you insights into data structures, algorithms, and a basic web application development.

Project Objectives -

To accurately outline the scope of work required for a project, it is crucial to first identify its objective.

Implement a Link Shortner system in java.

Develop functions to shorten long URLs and expand short URLs to their original form.

Ensure the uniqueness of short URLs and handle potential collisions.

Explore basic error handling and user feedback.

Gain practical experience in Java programming data structure, and algorithmic thinking.

Requirements and Features -

Use Java as the primary programming languages.
Create a class or set of classes that manages the shortning and expanding of URLs.
Implement a basic hash function for generating short URLs.
Include error handling to address scenarios like duplicate long URLs and invalid short URLs.
Optionally, consider persisting data to maintain link mappings between sessions.
Develope a simple command-line interface(CLI) or web-based interface for user interaction.
